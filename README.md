# Overview

I love old 2D games from Nintendo and Sega.  To keep things fun, but productive I built a game using the Arcade Academy Library for Python.  It's important to research and learn how use imported libraries when coding in Python.  This allowed to reminisce and exercise my research abilities to learn about a vast Library
to build a Python game.

The game is a challenge to find 3 coins in 30 seconds.  Each coin is drawn in random locations to the screen. What makes it challenging is that you can't see uncharted territory on the game view.  In order to reveal the screen and the coins, the player must use the Up, Down, Left, and Right arrow keys to move the player image.

The game reminds me of the old dungeon levels on games where locations on maps can only become visible if you have traveled to that location.  I fond memories of old 2D games and wanted to build my own simple version of the same concept.

# Development Environment

I built the game using the Arcade Academy Library.  For stability, I also created a virtual environment to run my code in. And, I used Atom as my IDE

I used the Python language exclusively to build my game.  Imported libraries include, the Arcade library and the Random library.

# Future Work

* Add a list of best times
* Add animation to the player image
* Create a more dynamic dungeon similar to old 2D RPG games
